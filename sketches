However, it is interesting to note that he has not yet thought of introducing the central theme of the painting: the cat chasing the goldfinch, which will distinguish this composition from the traditional Holy Family iconography. As a result, scholars think that this sketch is one of the first surviving preparatory drawings for ‘The Madonna of the Cat (‘La Madonna del Gatto’)’. <br/>© Photo Scala, Florence - courtesy of the Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali\nFile:R-0024-00-000002-PYR.tif (3660x1819px)",

The idea of depicting the interaction between the two children had proved very successful during the Renaissance and Barocci may have had examples by Raphael and other masters in mind whilst executing this early sketch. <br/>© By courtesy of the Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali\nFile:R-0025-00-000002-PYR.tif (3050x2943px)",

In both studies the two children are about to kiss each other. However, in this drawing, which is in worse condition, Barocci uses the technique of white heightening to depict the light effects used in the mother and child group. It is clear that Barocci had already decided at this stage that the light source for his painting should be placed to the left of the composition. <br/>© By courtesy of the Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali\nFile:R-0026-00-000002-PYR.tif (3687x2648px)",

On the top right part of the drawing Barocci explores the group of the Virgin, Christ Child and Saint John the Baptist once more. This time the figures are placed on three different levels: the Virgin in the background, her vivacious son in the middle and his cousin, with his half-extended left leg, in the foreground. With its front paws leaning on the child’s knee, the cat is depicted staring at what appear to be the first indications of a goldfinch in Saint John’s hand. <br/>© By courtesy of the Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali\nFile:R-0028-00-000002-PYR.tif (3894x2728px)",

He began experimenting in black chalk, but then inverted the sheet to continue a new series of drawings in pen and wash. His main concerns were the distribution of light and shadow, and the young John the Baptist’s dynamic diagonal pose. Barocci’s sensitive use of wash highlights key passages such as the Virgin’s bare breast and the children’s joyful expressions. <br/>© Photo Scala, Florence - courtesy of the Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali\nFile:R-0056-00-000002-PYR.tif (3207x2539px)",
